This allows for each movement state to be isolated in their own script. This prevents the chance of one script become too large to easily maintain, and also makes mechanic debugging far easier. This aids my efficiency in implementing player movement mechanics, if there is an issue I can dial the issue down to one single state, identifying one single script that the issue will be happening within. I have implemented the following movement states into my player:</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="-ajb6k7_5844"><li class="list__item" id="-ajb6k7_5845"><p>Idle</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-ajb6k7_5846"><p>Walking</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-ajb6k7_5847"><p>Sprinting</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-ajb6k7_5848"><p>Jumping</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-ajb6k7_5849"><p>Airborne</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-ajb6k7_5850"><p>Wall Running</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-ajb6k7_5851"><p>Wall Jumping</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-ajb6k7_5852"><p>Sliding</p></li></ul><section class="chapter"><h3 id="player-state-machine-flowchart" data-toc="player-state-machine-flowchart">Player State Machine Flowchart</h3><p id="-ajb6k7_5853">To explain how this Finite State Machine works, I have produced a flowchart that explains the basic workflow:</p><figure id="-ajb6k7_5854"><a href="images/player_state_machine.png" class="lightbox"><img alt="Player Movement State Machine" src="images/player_state_machine.png" title="Player Movement State Machine" width="6294" height="2368"></a></figure><p id="-ajb6k7_5855">This is also being done to make the players input feel as responsive as possible. I have set this finite state machine up to be completely configurable, allowing these implementation to give the player a fluid feeling of movement. This also allows for a deeper level of input feedback alongside hopefully increasing the potential to become immersed in my game.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="player-settings-showcase" data-toc="player-settings-showcase">Player Settings Showcase</h3><figure id="-ajb6k7_5856"><a href="images/player_settings.png" class="lightbox"><img alt="Player Settings Showcase" src="images/player_settings.png" title="Player Settings Showcase" width="298" height="500"></a></figure></section></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="camera" data-toc="camera">Camera</h2><p id="-ajb6k7_5857">I also followed a similar approach with the Camera system within the game, applying a secondary Finite State System. To achieve this, I used the beta version of the Cinemachine Unity package - Version 3.0 to be specific. This allowed me to isolate each camera perspective from one another, further preventing there being one huge script that becomes obfuscated with the sheer amount of lines. I have managed to implement the following perspectives:</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="-ajb6k7_5858"><li class="list__item" id="-ajb6k7_5859"><p>First-Person Perspective</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-ajb6k7_5860"><p>Third-Person Perspective</p></li></ul><section class="chapter"><h3 id="camera-state-machine-flowchart" data-toc="camera-state-machine-flowchart">Camera State Machine Flowchart</h3><p id="-ajb6k7_5861">To explain my proposed structure of this Finite State Machine, I also produced a flowchart explaining the workflow:</p><figure id="-ajb6k7_5862"><a href="images/camera_state_machine.png" class="lightbox"><img alt="Camera State Machine" src="images/camera_state_machine.png" title="Camera State Machine" width="4256" height="2080"></a></figure><p id="-ajb6k7_5863">I was initially intending on implementing more varieties of camera perspectives within my game, however the amount of time it took to learn the new Cinemachine 3.0 API and integrate that with the state machine was taking too much time. I decided to cut my losses and stick to only two perspectives, which can be showcased throughout play-through of my game. It is not the most perfect implementation as I ran out of time to finish of the third person mechanics within the game, but it can still be shown working transitioning between each state.</p></section></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="weapons" data-toc="weapons">Weapons</h2><p id="-ajb6k7_5864">I designed the weapon mechanics in my game around a single base class - this allows for me to easily implement any further weapons, using the configurability that I have designed in the base class. Throughout development, I have been able to implement two weapons:</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="-ajb6k7_5865"><li class="list__item" id="-ajb6k7_5866"><p>Pistol</p></li><li class="list__item" id="-ajb6k7_5867"><p>Shotgun</p></li></ul><p id="-ajb6k7_5868">I would have ideally liked to have more implemented towards the end of development, but I feel like these two weapons are enough to showcase in my vertical slice. The base class has been designed to have the options to switch between projectiles, or raycast, and also allows for the option to have object pooling, increasing the efficiency / optimisation of my game.</p><section class="chapter"><h3 id="weapon-settings-showcase" data-toc="weapon-settings-showcase">Weapon Settings Showcase</h3><figure id="-ajb6k7_5869"><a href="images/weapon_settings.png" class="lightbox"><img alt="Weapon Settings Showcase" src="images/weapon_settings.png" title="Weapon Settings Showcase" width="543" height="500"></a></figure></section></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="enemy-ai" data-toc="enemy-ai">Enemy AI</h2><p id="-ajb6k7_5870">I initially intended for my enemies AI to be far more advanced than it actually turned out to be. I initially intended for my enemies to have the ability to wall run, just like the player could. However, due to several attempts to implement this within unity, it turned out to be far far far more difficult than I had originally expected it to be, causing my to remove the idea and stick with a basic enemy implementation.</p><p id="-ajb6k7_5871">I set up an enemies weapon mechanic, deriving from the base class for the weapons I mentioned in the section beforehand. This then allows for further configuration of the enemy AI and its complexity; allowing it to scale with the difficulty as the player progresses through the game.</p><section class="chapter"><h3 id="enemy-settings-showcase" data-toc="enemy-settings-showcase">Enemy Settings Showcase</h3><figure id="-ajb6k7_5872"><a href="images/enemy_settings.png" class="lightbox"><img alt="Enemy Settings Showcase" src="images/enemy_settings.png" title="Enemy Settings Showcase" width="456" height="500"></a></figure></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="enemy-weapon-settings-showcase" data-toc="enemy-weapon-settings-showcase">Enemy Weapon Settings Showcase</h3><figure id="-ajb6k7_5873"><a href="images/enemy_weapon_settings.png" class="lightbox"><img alt="Enemy Weapon Settings Showcase" src="images/enemy_weapon_settings.png" title="Enemy Weapon Settings Showcase" width="524" height="500"></a></figure></section></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="ui" data-toc="ui">UI</h2><p id="-ajb6k7_5874">UI within my game is very basic - it is rather minimal, whilst still being enough to explain what is going on within the game. If I had more time to work on this project, I would have extended the variety of UI assets that would have been implemented within my game.</p><figure id="-ajb6k7_5875"><a href="images/ui_showcase.png" class="lightbox"><img alt="UI Showcase" src="images/ui_showcase.png" title="UI Showcase" width="881" height="500"></a></figure></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="environment" data-toc="environment">Environment</h2><p id="-ajb6k7_5876">I have a few scripts that control the environment within my game. This ranges from a light flickering script, to a move walls script, to some out of bound sensors. These scripts are crucial to making my environment feel interactive throughout play-through.</p></section><div class="last-modified">Last modified: 23 April 2024</div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom"><a href="development-timelines.html" class="navigation-links__prev">Development Timelines</a><a href="tutorial.html" class="navigation-links__next">Game Tutorial</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/writerside/apidoc/6.6.6-b224/app.js"></script></body></html>
