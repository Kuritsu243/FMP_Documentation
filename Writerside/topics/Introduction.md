# Introduction

For my Final Major Project, I have created a first-person shooter game using the Unity Game Engine.
This game revolves around parkour-based movement mechanics. Throughout the development phase of this project, 
I have been able to produce a vertical slice of my game, Timeleap. Had I had more time to do so, I would have aimed
to create a full game. This Game Design Document (GDD) aims to give an overview of my project, by covering a range of things,
such as the game narrative, key mechanics and the development timeline.

**Disclaimer:
This documentation is viewed most optimally on the deployed GitHub pages I have set up for this documentation.
