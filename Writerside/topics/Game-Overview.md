# Game Overview

## Game Inspiration
For my Final Project, I initially took heavy inspiration from the following games:
- Call of Duty Black Ops 3
- Titan Fall 2
- Mirrors Edge
- Rollerdrome


I made this choice as reference for inspiration because these games all feature gameplay
that revolve around the movement mechanics that have been implemented. The movement mechanics
featured in these games are also crucial to the gameplay experience of their target audience(s).

I mostly took inspiration from these games regarding environment design; they are all set in
a futuristic timeframe, however some levels within these games appear to use different time-periods
as inspiration. This has led to my games environment revolve around a destroyed world; which explains
why there are floating islands - the destroyed environment also allows the player to use the movement
mechanics I have implemented in this game to traverse through the levels.

## Genre
I have designed this game with three genres in mind:
- FPS
- Action
- Parkour


Now that the game has been made, I believe that the work I have produced allows for my game to
fall under these genres, though in some areas it may be a loose-fit. I chose these genres as inspiration
because the action and parkour genres tend to accompany each other rather well, especially showcased in other
popular games under these genres. I also targeted the FPS genre because it is what I am personally most
experience with regarding the production of games.

## Narrative

Timeleap has a very basic narrative featured in the game. This is mostly due to me perceiving my projects from an
almost truly technical perspective, which makes it difficult to come up with game elements such as a narrative or story.

The narrative featured in Timeleap purely revolves around the tutorial scene; as this is the whole premise / set-up for the narrative
within my game. The tutorial scene teaches the player the basic controls and an introduction to the movement featured. The player then
comes across a pistol, that the game then tells the player to pick-up and then shoot a non-hostile NPC, who is shown to be stood
next to a campfire. However, upon shooting the NPC, a futuristic looking platform / island appears, carrying more enemies - this time
they're carrying weapons. This acts as a way to indicate to the player that whoever the NPC was that they killed, was not 
the best person to choose to kill out of impulse. The player then defeats the hostile enemies, and the game tells the player to
interact with the giant satellite at the end of the platform, which is highlighted using a red outline. Upon interacting with the computer,
a portal appears and the player goes through it. The player then ends up on another floating island, but there is a different time-setting
in this stage. Accompanied by this, there are also even more hostile enemies that are displeased with the player. 

## Unique Selling Points (USPs)

### Unique Selling Point 1: Movement Mechanics

One of the main selling points for my game is that the games functionality revolves around the movement mechanics that
are implemented within. This is because a lot of games that are advertised to be parkour-shooter games tend to focus primarily
on the other mechanics in a game, making the games movement feeling like it was added as an afterthought. This is the main aim
that I'm trying to prevent with my game.

### Unique Selling Point 2: Cross-platform compatibilities

Another main selling point for my game is that it will be available on two desktop platforms; both Windows and Linux. This
was designed mostly in mind with the increasing popularity of hand-held gaming devices running Linux, such as the Steam Deck.
According to the [Steam Hardware Survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam),
the percentage of gamers using Linux is steadily increasing, alongside the percentage of gamers using Windows slowly decreasing.
By making this game both Linux and Windows native, it increases the availability of my game while making gamers on each platform 
more likely to consider purchasing this game, if it was ever officially released. This has been further achieved by using the Vulkan
Graphics API, with the same graphics front-end for both platforms it removes the limits of only having certain features only available on 
a single platform.

### Unique Selling Point 3: Game Optimisation

The targeted optimisation of my game can be another unique selling point for my game. With upcoming newly releasing games requiring
a more and more high-end computer specification to run the games smoothly, it's becoming increasingly difficult for gamers on older hardware
to run newly released games at a smooth frame-rate. The optimisations in my game aim to alleviate this; I want anyone who is interested in playing my game,
to be able to play my game at an enjoyable experience.

## Target Audience

I have designed this game with a wide target audience for this game. The ideal target audience for my game would be gamers,
ideally on the desktop platform, who have an interest in fast-paced movement mechanics within shooter games. As mentioned in my 
Unique Selling Points, I want to have as wide of a target audience as possible, as a way to extend the games outreach to potential
players of this game.
