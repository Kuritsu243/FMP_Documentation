# Development Timelines

## Term 1 - Pre-Production Timeline


![Term 1 - Pre-Production Timeline](pre_production_timeline.png){thumbnail="true"}

This was my initial proposed development timeline for the pre-production period of my game.
I tried to stick with this plan as much as possible throughout the pre-production phase, however I'd
say that I fell behind in certain areas, causing me to have to do some catching up during the production phase.

## Term 2 - Production Timeline

This was my initial development timeline for the production period of my game. I would have liked to say I stuck with it, 
however the only thing I truly followed through with this was work towards the mechanics, and then aimed on getting everything
else complete towards the end of the production phase.
