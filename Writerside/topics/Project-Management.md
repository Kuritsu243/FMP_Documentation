# Project Management

Throughout both the pre-production phase and production phase of this project, I have used a variety of software to
store and use reference of what files have been worked on and when.

## GitHub / Git CLI

This was the main use of external services being used by my project. I've also used this as a method to keep track with my 
project development and progression - the ability to look through my commit history, track the changes to files I've made
is extremely helpful.

## Discord

I've used my own personal discord server as a method to store reference to certain areas of my project that I need to develop
further, as well as sometimes a last-minute method to send files between devices. I have also used this to communicate with my 
fellow course-mates, to receive feedback and help on certain areas I had become stuck with throughout the project development.
