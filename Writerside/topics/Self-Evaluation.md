# Critical Reflection
<show-structure depth="2" />

## Introduction

Over the course of the last two terms, with the pre-production and production units, I would
say that overall I am pleased with the game that I have produced. I have been able to
extend my skills and knowledge with C# and the unity engine, learning more advanced
implementations of features that I would have taken a completely different approach
towards at the start of my degree. I have learnt these features alongside a more
professional approach on how to code a mechanic within the game engine, whilst trying to
keep it as efficient as possible. This also ties in with other characteristics, such as naming
conventions, script tidiness and moving functions to a subclass when one single script or
class is growing too large.

## Development Process

Next time, I would ideally like to change my approach towards the game's development
process by focusing on building a foundation of documentation and planning in my game,
instead of making it up as I go on. The approach that I have given my project and the
development process the last two terms of university has caused multiple downfalls,
mostly not making a steady amount of progress each week, causing me to do coding
sprints, which admittedly is not the healthiest practice to do during phases of development.
I would ideally like to take a less optimistic approach towards the number of features and
mechanics that I believe I would be able to implement within a game in a certain time-span
too; my initial concept of having a high fidelity and “ultra-immersive” parkour / movement
system in my game was too optimistic – and I only truly determined how optimistic this
approach was when I was halfway through the conceptualisation of these mechanics. Due
to my being late with actually concepting these mechanics, too – it was too late to
backtrack on my initial game plan and idea. This also reflects what it would be like in the
game industry; if there is preparation for a game with specific mechanics to be made,
only to be reverted far into the project, it just would not work.
The combination of the initial overly optimistic approach alongside doing sprints of work as
an attempt to not be extremely behind in my project has resulted in the production of a
game that originally had far more potential compared to the finished product. This is a
frequent occurrence with my solo projects, ultimately falling on my time management skills
alongside lack of initial research. This shows and ultimately makes me realise further that I
need to restructure my approach towards doing solo projects, instead of progressing
through my projects out of impulse, and to not only have a solid schedule, but to follow the
schedule.

## Data Loss / Unplanned Issues

Through the development phase of my project, I had two sudden hardware / software
failures on two devices that I had unaccounted for to happen during this project period.
This inevitably led to me losing around two weeks of work that I did whilst home over
Easter. This was mainly due to my reliance of having a local copy of my project on both
systems at the same time, but this plan never accounts for the unluckiness of both devices
having issues at the same time. An extremely unlucky situation, but due to my oversights it
could have been prevented from the start. My methodology throughout the entire project
has been to store everything backed up on GitHub, but this is only done when I manually
upload my project to GitHub. To circumvent this, I’d like to implement some form of
automation into my future projects, to ensure that whatever work I do will automatically be
saved to off-site / cloud storage as a method to avoid these issues from happening.
My lack of vision towards various cloud services i.e., OneDrive and Google Drive due to
having issues with those services in the past has put me off from implementing some form
of automation. However, it is clear now that this is something to do next time I start a project that
spans multiple months in length. 

## Linux / Vulkan

From the initial start of the project, I stated that I was going to make this project be
supported on both Windows and Linux, due to the Vulkan graphics API. This has been
relatively issue-free, mostly due to my use of Linux on my main computer and previous
experience / knowledge using this operating system. What I did not account for, however,
are issues with the Unity Engine itself, due to being on the bleeding-edge of software
updates for drivers, kernel, Vulkan and Unity. This has slowed down development progress
from time to time, or even demotivating me from even getting up-to-speed to easily
progress on my game; my project would crash eight out of ten times even trying to load up
my project. This can be circumvented by already having my computers / systems already
prepared for the game development cycle, instead of having to deal with an issue halfway
through a development sprint / when I am actually wanting to get work done instead of
having to deal with any unneeded issues.

## Attendance

My attendance throughout this academic year, especially during the Production unit, has
been severely lacking. This hinders the standard of professional practice that is expected
as of a student in their third year of university. The lacking is mostly due to my lack of
motivation / poor attitude towards this project, especially with the issues that I have
become aware of and realised throughout the development process. This can easily be
circumvented; I just need to actually attend to lessons by managing a consistent level of
time management and somehow keep a stable level of motivation and attitude towards my
personal and academic projects. This has most likely led to me missing out on crucial pieces
of knowledge to use within my own project, and within future games that I would hopefully
be working on.

## Conclusion

Overall, I’d like to say I’m rather happy with the outcome of this project, which is challenging to
do so once highlighting all the negatives that has happened during the last two terms.
This is ultimately my blame, however, a huge portion of the issues faced could have
been dealt with beforehand had I kept some steady form of structure towards planning and
doing enough research regarding features in my game that I had initially planned for. The
pieces of knowledge I have gained throughout this project, however, will not be forgotten
and will continuously be used by me with other programming projects
