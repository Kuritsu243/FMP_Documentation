# Feedback Received
<show-structure depth="2" />

## Feedback Plan

Throughout the development period, I have mostly received good constructive criticism from my peers / course-mates, alongside my housemates. The difference
between the two groups of feedback is:
- Feedback from course-mates would be viewed from a more technical standpoint, more games centric.
- Feedback from housemates would be an outsiders view into my project, which helps give more general information that a similar person may feel when they view my game for the first time.

## Methods of Feedback

### Online

The largest amount of feedback that I received was from online platforms, especially Discord. This is due to the third year students
on games technology having a discord server (basically a group-chat) where we discuss project progression and course work. This has been informal 
pieces of feedback, but still extremely useful because it gets straight to the point of what changes I needed / I need to make.

#### Example

### In-Person

I also received an extremely large amount of feedback in-person - talking in class during the progression stand-ups, showing others the project,
etc. This ranged from students, lecturers, non-university students and even just some people I have never met before who happened to see I had my project open.
I can't really provide a literal example of feedback, but most of the feedback was constructive about how to approach things differently.

### Myself

As posted multiple times on the internet, [you are your own worst critic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/r5g2jx/why_are_we_our_own_worst_critic/) The number
of changes, restructures and restarting I have done regarding certain mechanics and environmental aspects within the game throughout the development phase have been **large**.
If I spent multiple hours working on certain features, there was a high chance I'd return to the project the next day and then modify almost completely the approach I initially took.
This led to some fine-tuning to certain scripts and settings that just make my game feel nicer to play compared to the originally clunky approaches. This reflects upon the large number of variables
that some of my scripts have, especially my [Player Controller script.](PlayerController-cs.md)

## Conclusion

I think next time I would have liked to do online feedback, most likely via Google forms or a similar medium. I originally proposed this concept during the pre-production
unit, however, I simply ran out of time before doing this. Sending this out to a large group of people would have shown levels of anonymity and an easy way to access a compiled
list of feedback.
