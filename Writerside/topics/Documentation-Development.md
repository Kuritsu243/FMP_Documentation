# Documentation Development

## Introduction

My deployment of documentation this year is different compared to a plain word or PowerPoint document. This is due to me using
a piece of software called JetBrains Writerside. This software converts pages, written in Markdown, to an actual webpage listing documentation.
The software itself is currently in early access, so I thought that this would be a good time to test this out and teach myself how to write 
documentation in Markdown further than I already knew. It also has useful features, such as the ability to export documentation to PDF, making this
a very versatile piece of software depending on what type of documentation deployment I am aiming for.

The raw files for this documentation can be accessed on [my GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Kuritsu243/FMP_Documentation), where you can 
find the markdown files for each page before they have been converted to webpage format and deployed to GitHub Pages. 

## Benefits

- Structure: Markdown is a very versatile format, allowing my documentation to be formatted by different websites i.e. GitHub
- Learning Markdown: Extending my knowledge further with Markdown is extremely beneficial, especially as seeing that services such as GitHub use to display documentation for repositories.
- Appearance: Using this results in spotless looking documentation for my project, and can be more intriguing compared to a Word document.

## Downside

- Formatting: Exporting to other formats i.e. PDF loses support of specific image formatting, and loses the support for GIFs and video files to be implemented.
- Reliance on software: To add changes to my work, I have to use writerside. Maybe a problem when the software exits EAP and becomes a paid-for product.
- Early Access Software: The risk of undiscovered bugs may break certain pieces of software, full reliance is a bad idea.
