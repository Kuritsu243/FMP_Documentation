# Game Tutorial
<show-structure depth="2" />

The first level that the player plays of this game is the game tutorial. This is also the setup for the games narrative and plot.
I have done this because it is a good way of introducing the game to the player; they get to learn the games controls and the basic
game flow.

## Stage 1: Starting Island

The starting island is where the player spawns in. At first, they are prompted to press the basic key inputs to move around in-game. 
Once the player has completed this, some walls will move up and stay floating, in the direction towards the next island. The player is then
told the basics of how to wall run, and how to jump between walls.

## Stage 2: Weapon Island

The named "weapon island" is where the player first picks up a pistol, and is told by the tutorial to shoot a non-hostile NPC. This introduces
the player to the weapon mechanics implemented within the game, and also sets up the narrative for the remainder of the game.

## Stage 3: Enemy Island

The enemy island appears once the player kills the non-hostile NPC. This gives the player the challenge of defeating three hostile
enemies, giving them an introduction to what the enemies they'll be fighting throughout the game are like. This is configured to be
an easy challenge, so that the player does not get a sense of defeat this early on in a game. Upon defeating the enemies, the player
is then told to interact with a giant computer, which is highlighted with a red outline. Upon interacting, a portal opens up and the
player is told to jump through it.
