# Attendance and Engagement

## Pre-Production

My attendance and engagement / participation in class for the pre-production unit was
rather good – the only thing that was lacking from time to time was my attendance,
however this did not hinder my ability to produce my work. It still reflects poorly upon the
expected standard of professional practice however, and I’ll aim to improve this in the
future.

## Production

My attendance for this unit was severely lacking – which even caused me to have a couple
attendance meetings arranged by the university. There is no reason behind this except a
general lack of motivation towards my own projects and university as a whole. This
hopefully has not hindered my abilities to produce my project to a knowledgeable level,
however. My presentations regarding progress were rather short, compared to the rest of
my companions in class – which shows that with a set structure, strict schedule and an
overall positive attitude towards the unit are extremely beneficial regarding engagement
and participation throughout this unit. When I was actually attending my lessons however, I
feel like my engagement and participation was to the levels expected by the lecturer. I still
presented my presentations and engaged with the class.
