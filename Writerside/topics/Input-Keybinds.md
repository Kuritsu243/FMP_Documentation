# Input &amp; Keybindings

## Keyboard and Mouse Input
I intend for this game to mostly be played with Keyboard and Mouse input. The default control scheme is
the following:

- **W**: Forward
- **A**: Left
- **S**: Right
- **D**: Backwards
- **V**: Camera Perspective
- **C**: Player Slide
- **Spacebar**: Player Jump
- **Mouse Movement / Delta**: Player Look
- **Mouse 1** (Left Click): Player Shoot
- **Mouse 2** (Right Click): Player Aim (**Not Implemented**)

## Controller Input

I also initially intended to implement controller input, alongside keyboard and mouse input. Due to leaving this too
late in the project, I have not had the time to implement this. If this were to be integrated into the final game, the default 
control map would be the following (using Xbox One Controller Scheme as reference):

- **Left Joy Axis**: Player Movement
- **Right Joy Axis**: Player Look
- **A**: Jump
- **Left Joy Button**: Player Slide
- **Left Trigger**: Player Aim (**Not Implemented**)
- **Right Trigger**: Player Shoot
- **Select**: Camera Perspective
